Non-Functional Requirements
Performance
- The frontend should respond within 2 seconds for each user interaction.
- React and Flutter interfaces must load quickly even on slow internet connections (â‰¤ 3 Mbps).
- Backend API must handle at least 500 requests per minute without noticeable delays.
- Uploaded files (videos, PDFs) should be compressed to optimize load and storage time.
Security
- User passwords must be encrypted using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and session management.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions by user type (Student, Teacher, Parent).
- Protect the system against SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.
- All communication between client and server must occur over HTTPS.
- Validate uploaded files and restrict file types to safe formats (e.g., PDF, MP4).
Scalability
- Backend should allow horizontal scaling as the number of users increases.
- Architecture should support modular or microservice expansion for future features.
- System should handle simultaneous requests from multiple users efficiently.
Reliability
- Ensure at least 99.5% uptime.
- Implement proper error handling to avoid crashes and provide clear feedback to users.
- Automate daily backups for PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases.
- Failure of one service must not affect the operation of others.
Usability
- Interface should be intuitive, responsive, and easy to navigate for users of all ages.
- Design should be mobile-friendly and support multiple screen sizes.
- Flutter app interfaces must be optimized for Android and iOS.
- Support both Arabic and English languages.
Maintainability
- Follow modular, clean, and well-documented coding practices.
- Use Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- Separate frontend and backend for easier updates and maintenance.
- Maintain a dedicated testing environment before deploying new features.
Compatibility
- Web app should be compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- Mobile app should run on both Android and iOS platforms.
- RESTful API should be interoperable with third-party applications (e.g., Google Meet, AI APIs).
Testability
- Provide a testing environment separate from production.
- Write unit tests for backend using Jest or Mocha.
- Use React Testing Library for frontend testing.
- Conduct performance and security tests before deployment.
AI and Advanced Features Reliability
- Ensure AI-related modules do not degrade system performance.
- Store AI analysis results in separate collections or databases.
- Monitor API usage and resource consumption regularly to maintain stability.
